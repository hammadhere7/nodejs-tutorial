# What is Node JS

Node Js is an open source cross platform backend javascript runtime environment. Node JS runs on V8 engine and execute javascript code outside a web browser.

**Written:** NodeJs written in C, C++ and Javascript.

**Author Of Node JS:** Ryan Dahl is an author or Node Js. Ryan Dahl is a Software Engineer also Deno and TypeScript.

**What is V8:** V8 is a Google's open source javascript engine. V8 written in C++ and used in Chrome. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and run on many plateforms like window 7, maxOS, Linux systems.

### Javascript Engine

Javascript Engine basically a program that converts javascript code into something that can be understand by machine. Javascript engines are typically developed by web browser verndors, and every major browser has one.

  - V8 ( V8 from google most used javascript engine)

### Blocking IO

### Non-Blocking IO

### Synchronous Communiation

### Asynchronous Communication

### Single Thread or Multi-threaded

# Why Use NodeJS

- Non-blocking IO
- One language on frontend and backend
- Built on top of V8 which is built using C++ so low level operations are possible
- Cross platform
- Not going anywhere
- Not a bloated framework. Very slim and you can add dependencies as you need2
- Lightweight, ideal for microservices architecture


## NodeJS is suitable for IO applications



# How it works under the hood
